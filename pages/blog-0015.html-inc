So I am preparing a presentation of the new SDL perl for February's Toronto Perl Mongers meeting. What better way to so off SDL perl then with a game? <br />
<br />
I started hacking a small point an click game a few days back. I really didn't have a idea in mind, but I did have a goal. I wanted to make a game that shows the basics of a game in SDL. Drawing to screen, game loops, physics and so on. I think I have accomplished it so far. <br />
<br />
Take a look at it <a alt="Click the balls to win" href="http://gist.github.com/301949">here</a>. Download that and call it<a alt="Click the balls to win" href="http://gist.github.com/301949">[Shooter.pl]</a>. To win click the balls.<br />
<br />
To play this game you need the following:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> <b>Only for Linux)</b> sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev libsdl_gfx-dev </li>
<li> cpan Alien::SDL </li>
<li> Click Download Source http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/tree/redesign </li>
<li> Extract it </li>
<li> perl Build.PL; perl Build; perl Build install </li>
<li> perl Shooter.pl </li>
</ul><br />
I will put up binaries soon-ish.<br />
<br />
It is a playable (albeit hard) game right now. All 7 seven levels of it. The purpose of the game is simple click the balls to win. Sounds easy but it isn't. You also get a time in milliseconds after each level. Share your scores on here! I will leave it up to you guys to be honest. <br />
<br />
I do have to tidy it up and right documentation for it. This way I will be able to present it clearly to my fellow mongers. I am also still looking for ideas to make this a more polished game. FROGGS recommend I make it a classic NES duck hunt game. I thought since I am using gravity I could do a UFO game out of it where you shoot the UFOs. I am open to your ideas.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-1585061047069454098?l=yapgh.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
