The gists of the argument was that SDL perl should be making platform specific packages for end users. I agree with this idea but I do have to face the truth. <br /><br />The truth is there are very few developers currently working on SDL Perl. The truth is CPAN provides several tools that which currently drives development for SDL Perl. There are people interested in packaging SDL Perl (<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49003">kmx</a>, <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.sdl.devel/2009/09/msg1433.html">jean</a> and Jerome Quelin). The truth is there are other very <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49084">critical areas</a> we can focus on. <br /><br />If there are people looking to package SDL Perl for their platform please contact us at sdl-devel@perl.org.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-6565605958523853965?l=yapgh.blogspot.com'/></div></div></div>
