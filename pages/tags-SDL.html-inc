This was then exported into the SDL module. This means that the XS file has to handle with macros if any component (e.x SDL_Mixer) is not compiled. Moreover having ever binding in one XS file prevents use to treat C structs as object with only one point of free and malloc. This would be BEGIN and DESTROY in Perl. Also the monolithic design introduces a lot of bugs because we have to use free and malloc all over the place. Lastly SDL monolithic design has the constructor for all structs in both Perl and in XS. <br /> The design we are aiming for Simple  one XS  per Module.

Since this will be a big undertaking   I asked for some help from  chromatic  and  garu . We came up with the   following plan for v2.4. <br /> Currently all XS is mapped to the SDL_perl module. This does not reflect the modular nature of the sdl libs. So the plan is to gradually move SDL structs and their respective functions to their correct namespaces. We will start with SDL::Rect as garu has  added many tests    for it. This way the build system will be a lot easier to hack since Module::Build was made for one XS per module. Moreover we will move the Build utilities to Alien::SDL, making it even simpler. The main idea is to adhere to single responsibility principle and encapsulation.  <br /> Obviously this will take some time and effort, but it will pay off in the long run.
