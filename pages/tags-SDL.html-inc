We are trying to pick up our speed again. Hopefully we can get back to the weekly updates. This week I am going to try to get Mixer and TTF bindings test, redesigned and doc'd. Hopefully soon we can start working on Frozen Bubble, as things are starting to come together. This alpha release has finally given us a good implementation of SDL Timers. Also  Daniel Ruoso  has also started a series blog posts of making games with SDL Perl. Hopefully this can get more people in SDL, cause we can sure use the help!<br /> More to come --yapgh <br /><a href="blog-0001.html" style="font-size: 12px">[more]</a><br /><br /></div><hr /><div><a href="blog-0002.html">Threaded XS callback finally gets solved.</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Wednesday, 06 January 2010</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Tags:  <a href="tags-Perl.html" style="font-size: 10px">[Perl]</a> <a href="tags-SDL.html" style="font-size: 10px">[SDL]</a> <a href="tags-Updates.html" style="font-size: 10px">[Updates]</a> <a href="tags-XS.html" style="font-size: 10px">[XS]</a></span><br />So I was planning staying silent until an exam I had was done.

I suppose ... because we finally have threaded callbacks for timer and audiospec to work. ruoso++ for this major contribution. If you remember this was the  problem  we were having. <br />The new callbacks capability in audiospec allow you to procedurally generate sound now. If you would like a simple example take a look at   t/core_audiospec.t . However a more fun example may be ruoso++'s  tecla  (a game for toddlers).  Myself and Garu think it is a work of art but that is only because we are toddlers. <br />On a side note some tickets on RT have also received some love ( after 3 or 4 years ... but nonetheless).

This was then exported into the SDL module. This means that the XS file has to handle with macros if any component (e.x SDL_Mixer) is not compiled. Moreover having ever binding in one XS file prevents use to treat C structs as object with only one point of free and malloc. This would be BEGIN and DESTROY in Perl. Also the monolithic design introduces a lot of bugs because we have to use free and malloc all over the place. Lastly SDL monolithic design has the constructor for all structs in both Perl and in XS. <br /> The design we are aiming for Simple  one XS  per Module.

Since this will be a big undertaking   I asked for some help from  chromatic  and  garu . We came up with the   following plan for v2.4. <br /> Currently all XS is mapped to the SDL_perl module. This does not reflect the modular nature of the sdl libs. So the plan is to gradually move SDL structs and their respective functions to their correct namespaces. We will start with SDL::Rect as garu has  added many tests    for it. This way the build system will be a lot easier to hack since Module::Build was made for one XS per module. Moreover we will move the Build utilities to Alien::SDL, making it even simpler. The main idea is to adhere to single responsibility principle and encapsulation.  <br /> Obviously this will take some time and effort, but it will pay off in the long run.
