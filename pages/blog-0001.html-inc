</h1>
<div class="CONTENT">
<div style="text-align: right;"><i>We keep on rolling,<br />rolling,<br />waiting on the world to turn.</i><br /></div><br />So a new alpha is out on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kthakore/SDL-2.3_5/">CPAN</a>, after a bit of a break. We are trying to pick up our speed again. Hopefully we can get back to the weekly updates. This week I am going to try to get Mixer and TTF bindings test, redesigned and doc'd. Hopefully soon we can start working on Frozen Bubble, as things are starting to come together. This alpha release has finally given us a good implementation of SDL Timers. Also <a href="http://daniel.ruoso.com/categoria/perl/games-perl-1">Daniel Ruoso</a> has also started a series blog posts of making games with SDL Perl. Hopefully this can get more people in SDL, cause we can sure use the help!<br /><br /><i>More to come --yapgh</i><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-896792692004201189?l=yapgh.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div></div>
