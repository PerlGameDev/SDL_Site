We are trying to pick up our speed again. Hopefully we can get back to the weekly updates. This week I am going to try to get Mixer and TTF bindings test, redesigned and doc'd. Hopefully soon we can start working on Frozen Bubble, as things are starting to come together. This alpha release has finally given us a good implementation of SDL Timers. Also  Daniel Ruoso  has also started a series blog posts of making games with SDL Perl. Hopefully this can get more people in SDL, cause we can sure use the help!<br /> More to come --yapgh <br /><a href="blog-0001.html" style="font-size: 12px">[more]</a><br /><br /></div><hr /><div><a href="blog-0003.html">SDL Alpha 2: A sneak preview</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Sunday, 06 December 2009</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Tags:  <a href="tags-Perl.html" style="font-size: 10px">[Perl]</a> <a href="tags-Releases.html" style="font-size: 10px">[Releases]</a> <a href="tags-SDL.html" style="font-size: 10px">[SDL]</a></span><br />So over the past week we have been working hard to release the next Alpha for SDL-2.3.
