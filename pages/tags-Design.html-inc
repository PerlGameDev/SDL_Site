Our two core modules are getting to be a bit more stable. <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Alien-SDL+1.403">Alien::SDL 1.405  is behaving well. This foundational stability will start to show results in <a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=SDL+2.405">SDL  too I believe. Most excitingly the main developer of frozen-bubble is reviewing our <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kthakore/Games-FrozenBubble-2.202/lib/Games/FrozenBubble.pm">Games::FrozenBubble  port to CPAN. All good and well, but to keep this project going we need to improve.<br />  Getting people to use SDL Perl  <br />After a long chat with a new SDL user on #sdl today, I realize we still have some way to go. Currently it seems we are lacking in a few areas. We can definitely use some feedback and help in these areas. <br />  Tutorials/Documentation<br /> <br />  We have more docs now on http://sdl.perl.org but they suck <br /> What type of tutorials do you think will be good for beginners? <br />  A project start to finish? <br /> Individual tutorials for various topics? <br /> What needs to go in SDL::CookBook? <br />  <br /> API sweetness <br />  SDL Perl depends on distinct C libraries <br />  This makes naming conventions, data formats different the SDL:: namespaces <br /> How do people design this stuff? <br />  We are hackers and we just go do stuff but I think this needs some prior thought <br /> Any takers? <br />   <br /> Distribution <br />  If SDL scripts can be packaged up simply for game developers to distribute their games it will be a big plus <br />  One way is a Wx::Perl::Packer clone <br /> Another is a CPAN/Steam clone that game devs can upload games too and people can point and click download games?&nbsp; <br />    If anyone wants to help in these areas please talk to us on sdl-devel@perl.org.&nbsp;    <br /> <a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/9LDtns437JWMVWJoUGIR6gCE1W0/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/9LDtns437JWMVWJoUGIR6gCE1W0/0/di" border="0" ismap="true">  <br /><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/9LDtns437JWMVWJoUGIR6gCE1W0/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/9LDtns437JWMVWJoUGIR6gCE1W0/1/di" border="0" ismap="true">   <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/YetAnotherPerlGameHackeryapgh/~4/EXlozhjfhdo" height="1" width="1"/><br /><a href="blog-0010.html" style="font-size: 12px">[more]</a><br /><br /></div></div>
