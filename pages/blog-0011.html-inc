<div style="text-align: right;"><i>Silent but active,<br />Small but deadly. <br /></i><br /></div><br /><br /><h3>Updates</h3>Ok so my blog posts have gone down a bit due to me using my fingers for coding. We have started to get some updates to SDL docs so that good. Also some of the tutorials are shaping up. This is what I have been hacking this past week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NnqjAQEn1Xo/SrmNTm9UkKI/AAAAAAAAAA0/S0XNvXsp9u4/s1600-h/tetris.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NnqjAQEn1Xo/SrmNTm9UkKI/AAAAAAAAAA0/S0XNvXsp9u4/s320/tetris.jpg" /></a><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />You can grab the <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/TetrisPL">code</a>. Note you will have to install deps yourself. Read the README file. It is not a tutorial yet, because it was hacked together in ~50 hours. But it playable now. During building this I found out that MacOSX (and Snow Leopard) has died again.<br /><br /><h3>Hackfest</h3>So with dngor's help this sunday (27/09/09) we will have a hackfest to fix MacOSX support. Anyone with a MacOSX and wants to help is welcome on <a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?settings=89f140215d60860684cee2f6a917607f&amp;server=irc.perl.org&amp;channel=%23sdl">#sdl irc.perl.org</a>. We will also try to fix up a lot of docs and the tutorial for a early next week release. Also if we can we will migrate to the new site.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-7382145297295717151?l=yapgh.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div></div>
