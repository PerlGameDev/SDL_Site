<div style="text-align: right;"><i><br />idle digits,<br />play,<br />away,<br />idle digits.<br /></i></div><br />So while I am hacking away on v2.4 and <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/tree/experimental">breaking</a> a lot of things. Here is a link to some more <a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Eg.f.taylor/GarrysGames.html">games</a> for SDL Perl. These only work in windows now but I will look into bringing them to CPAN (with Garry's permission). <br /><br /><i>--yapgh</i><br /><br />These where reported by Garry Taylor. Here is the rest of the email:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Hi all,</i><br /><i>I hadn't checked this newsgroup in a while and was happy to see </i><br /><i>that it still alive and well.  I saw that some people had been sharing </i><br /><i>some SDL Perl games online, and I had a few to share as well. At </i><br /><i>"http://home.comcast.net/~g.f.taylor/GarrysGames.html" you can find four </i><br /><i>games I have written as well as a simple flip book program to let a </i><br /><i>child play at making animation on the computer.  The games are "Toad" (a </i><br /><i>Frogger wanna be), "RabbitHat" (like Centipede), "BunnyHunt" (sort of </i><br /><i>like Pac-Man) and "Bonk The Buggies".  All (with the exception of Toad </i><br /><i>which in its very first incarnation was a game I wrote in TRS-80 Basic </i><br /><i>back in 1981) were written originally to run on my Windows 3.11 PC for </i><br /><i>my little girl so that she could play games which were not quite so </i><br /><i>violent as games were starting to become at the time.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>A few years ago I got the idea of trying to get them to run again </i><br /><i>by rewriting them in Perl.  The downloads are Windows XP/Vista installs </i><br /><i>which include a bare bones Perl environment for running the games (the </i><br /><i>installs put the code into its own separate place, and shouldn't </i><br /><i>interfere with your existing Perl setups).  I did this so that I could </i><br /><i>share the games with friends and family who either don't have SDL </i><br /><i>installed, don't have Perl installed, or don't do any programming and </i><br /><i>just needed something that will run.  The code as it currently stands </i><br /><i>was not written for general publication, so there are probably places </i><br /><i>where the Perl code itself is not always the best looking it could be, </i><br /><i>but the games themselves work pretty well.  Also, it is worth noting </i><br /><i>that I wound up being lazy and made a few additions to the Perl SDL code </i><br /><i>that I was using to add an additional function or two for printing text </i><br /><i>onto the screen that was centered or right aligned.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>While I have not made any Unix installs for the code, I have </i><br /><i>actually run the games on a few Linux machines that I have access to, </i><br /><i>where I also had installed SDL.  I have not updated my SDL installs in </i><br /><i>several years now, so there may be complications that arise if running </i><br /><i>it with  a new version of SDL.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>I hope you enjoy the games (or at least aren't too mean about it </i><br /><i>if you don't).</i><br /><i>Garry Taylor</i></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-500220938152318100?l=yapgh.blogspot.com'/></div></div>
