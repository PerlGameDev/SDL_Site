This is what we have accomplished<br /><br /><br /><h3>Commitment to Testing!</h3>In an effort to focus on continuing our focus on testing we have setup a <a href="http://sdlperl.ath.cx:8080/app/public_projects/smoke_reports/1">Smolder</a> site for the SDL redesign process. Currently we have two platforms (linux, windows32) regularly tested on here. If there are more people following the redesign process and would like to share their test results; contact us at sdl-devel@perl.org and we will provide access to you.<br /><br /><h3>SDL::Video</h3>For the core development most of the focus has been on redesigning around the Video category of the SDL perl API. As of now we are <a href="http://bit.ly/2ar7bK">50% done</a>. 19 functions out of 38 functions have been implemented and tested. <br /><br /><br /><h3>Site Redesign + Migration</h3>On the end of the spectrum, Froggs has been hard at work on the <a href="http://froggs.de/sdlperl/">graphical design </a>of the site. More over with mst's help we will soon be migrating to http://sdl.perl.org. <br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Documentation</h3>Moreover this week we have seen an increase effort from magnet on the <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/commits/redesign">SDL docs</a>. Kudos!<br /><br /><br /><h3>SWIG Experimentation</h3>Finally <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/commits/swig">Katrina</a> has begun looking into SWIG as alternative for SDL in the future.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-5353247044730007101?l=yapgh.blogspot.com'/></div></div></div>
