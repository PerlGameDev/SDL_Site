Threaded XS callback finally gets solved.
</h1>
<div class="CONTENT">
<div style="text-align: right;"><i><br />Dragged down from the lofty isles,<br />into the guts and gore of the monster,<br />a welcoming cringe in the gut approaches. <br /></i><br /></div><br /><br />So I was planning staying silent until an exam I had was done. But new developers on IRC (j_king, felix and ruoso) pull me back in. Which is a good thing ... I suppose ... because we finally have threaded callbacks for timer and audiospec to work. ruoso++ for this major contribution. If you remember this was the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1791114/creating-threaded-callbacks-in-xs">problem</a> we were having. <br /><br />The new callbacks capability in audiospec allow you to procedurally generate sound now. If you would like a simple example take a look at <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/blob/redesign/t/core_audiospec.t"> t/core_audiospec.t</a>. However a more fun example may be ruoso++'s <a href="http://github.com/ruoso/tecla">tecla</a> (a game for toddlers).  Myself and Garu think it is a work of art but that is only because we are toddlers. <br /><br />On a side note some tickets on RT have also received some love ( after 3 or 4 years ... but nonetheless). TonyC++ sorry for the long time in response. <br /><br />More information on the <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/blob/redesign/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>. <br /><br />Also a shout out to FROGGS for his new SON!!!.
