I will redouble my effort to do <a href="http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/commit/e504c139e12e5592b5694292bb1882ee78b65b28">this</a>. </p><br /><p>However I am not sure where to start updating docs. Has anyone re-documented old modules before? Any advice? If anyone is interested in helping me to sort out documentation please contact me on sdl-devel@perl.org. For people wanting to learn the SDL base there is no better way.<br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-2082858297367668517?l=yapgh.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div></div>
