Being a newbie in Perl myself I thought I should take a shot.<br />I was thinking you can make projects more accessible to newbies by having a step by step plan included with where they need to look. For example for docs of SDL_perl:<br />  Look at SDL docs [ link ]  See where SDL_perl is using the same functions [ link ] and the docs to this file [ link ]  Use the pod format to add it to the source [ link to using pod ]  {BONUS} Come up with tutorial or cookbook [ link to example ]  Submit code to github [ link ] or email them to me [ link ]<br /><a href="blog-0015.html" style="font-size: 12px">[more]</a><br /><br /></div><hr /><div><a href="blog-0024.html">My milestones (itches) for gaming in Perl</a><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Tuesday, 25 August 2009</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px">Tags:  <a href="tags-Perl.html" style="font-size: 10px">[Perl]</a> <a href="tags-SDL.html" style="font-size: 10px">[SDL]</a> <a href="tags-personal.html" style="font-size: 10px">[personal]</a></span><br />As a new Perl developer I am able to contribute with  great enthusiasm  due to the  great community  and the fancies of the language. However I know that these things will fade and I will need something else to take the place. Usually what has worked for me in the past was to set milestones. These will act as roots, keeping me interested in being involved. After all in words better than mines.<br />  We all “scratch our own itches”. It’s why I started Linux, it’s why I started git, and it’s why I am still involved. -- Linus <br />  <br /><a href="blog-0024.html" style="font-size: 12px">[more]</a><br /><br /></div></div>
