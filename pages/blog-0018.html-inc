The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SDL_Perl/">stats</a> are currently at <span style="font-size: x-small;">[PASS(11) FAIL(6) NA(1) UNKNOWN(35)]</span>.<br /><br /><b>Some OK news:</b><br />As you can see we have some fails occurring in the smoke tests. This is occurring due to the <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/KTHAKORE/SDL_Perl-v2.2.2.11/t/mixerpm.t">test</a> on Mixer.pm. Mixer.pm depends on a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/09/msg5250346.html">sound card being available</a> to the user running the test. This can be fixed by adjusting the test to check for sound cards before it runs but I am at a lost on how to do that.<br />In regards to the unknowns occurring it is due to the *nixes and macs not having SDL libs installed. The will be fixed when Alien::SDL downloads and compiles sources.<br /><br /><b>Some not-so-great news:</b><br />Currently the XS code simplification work requires redesign and there are several different ways of redesigning. This may break backwards compatibility, hopefully we can work around this. Soon we will present the two arguments for the designs in the <a href="mailto:sdl-devel@perl.org">mailing list</a>. <br /><br /><br />Until next time here is&nbsp; a hint of something coming soon (credits go to garu):<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://imgur.com/B0a1y.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://imgur.com/B0a1y.png" width="200" /></a></div><i><br /></i><br /><i>--yapgh</i><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3102167581424744259-1014994097230880621?l=yapgh.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></div></div>
